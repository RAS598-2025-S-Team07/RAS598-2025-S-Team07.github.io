Specifically, we focus on developing an assistive follower robot using a TurtleBot 4 platform equipped with a depth camera and LiDAR. The system is designed to enable hands-free transportation of small items\u2014such as groceries, shopping bags, or tools\u2014and assist in tasks like carrying a camera for photography or videography. Our broader objective is to contribute to the development and normalization of assistive robotic technologies in everyday life.</p> <p>To operate effectively in real-world environments, the robot must support key features including global and local path planning, dynamic obstacle avoidance (e.g., navigating around moving pedestrians), and user-specific tracking to differentiate its intended user from others in the environment.</p> <p>While the initial project vision included more ambitious capabilities\u2014such as allowing the robot to lead the user, full SLAM integration, and advanced navigation using a gap-finding algorithm\u2014hardware limitations (notably issues with the depth camera and the turtlebot4_navigation package) led us to revise the project's scope. The final implementation focuses on local path planning, obstacle avoidance, and user's shoe detection as a mean for user localization. These features, along with the rationale for our design decisions, are detailed in the following sections.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#sensor-integration","title":"Sensor Integration","text":"<p>The assistive follower robot integrates both a depth camera and LiDAR to enable robust user tracking and situational awareness. The depth camera is primarily responsible for user recognition and tracking, while the LiDAR sensor is used for obstacle detection and environmental mapping. This combination allows the robot to navigate safely through dynamically changing environments.</p> <p>Beyond obstacle avoidance, LiDAR can also be leveraged to maintain an optimal following distance. Once the user's direction relative to the robot is known\u2014typically provided by the depth camera\u2014the robot can associate this direction with a corresponding LiDAR beam and monitor its distance reading. Although this feature has not yet been implemented, it presents a promising opportunity to enhance the robot's control behavior and responsiveness in future iterations.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#interaction","title":"Interaction","text":"<p>The TurtleBot 4 is equipped with a depth camera, LiDAR, and a Raspberry Pi, enabling effective sensing, interaction, and control. Due to the limited field of view of the depth camera and the computational constraints of the onboard Raspberry Pi, we adopted a lightweight user identification strategy based on shoe detection. A custom-trained model detects and localizes the user's shoes to estimate both the direction and distance of the user relative to the robot.</p> <p>Our original design envisioned a hybrid navigation framework in which the LiDAR would provide 360-degree obstacle detection, assist in maintaining a safe following distance, and enable real-time gap-finding for navigation. In scenarios where no viable local path was identified through the gap-finding algorithm, the robot would fall back on a SLAM-based approach using the Nav2 stack to generate a local map and plan an alternative route. This layered architecture was intended to allow the robot to adapt intelligently to complex, dynamic environments.</p> <p>However, due to persistent integration challenges with SLAM, Nav2, and the custom gap-finding algorithm, we revised our approach. The final implementation relies solely on local path planning, obstacle avoidance, and user direction input via shoe detection. In this setup, the robot receives the estimated direction of the user and initiates motion toward that direction using the gap-finding algorithm, while simultaneously maintaining environmental awareness and avoiding dynamic obstacles.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#data-collection-image-processing","title":"Data collection &amp; Image processing","text":"<p>To detect and localize shoes we focuse on developing a machine learning model capable of detecting shoes and estimating their position on-screen using an OAK-D camera mounted on a TurtleBot.

In this architecture, the robot primarily relies on a reactive gap-finding algorithm for real-time obstacle avoidance. However, in situations where a passable gap cannot be identified, the robot falls back on the SLAM-generated map to make informed navigation decisions. In this setup, a SLAM node runs continuously to map the environment as the robot moves. Once the user\u2019s heading is determined, it is sent as a goal to the Nav2 planner server. This server generates a global path based on the current map. My custom Reactive Gap Finder node, which subscribes to the /rpi_11/plan topic, receives this path, follows it, and performs local obstacle avoidance by identifying and navigating through gaps in the environment.The figures below, which provide a zoomed-in view of the rqt_graph, clearly illustrate this architecture. As shown, the SLAM Toolbox subscribes to the /rpi_11/scan topic to perform mapping and localization. Meanwhile, the FollowerGap_node subscribes to the /rpi_11/plan topic to receive the global path coordinates for local planning.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>From here, we present the key challenges encountered throughout the project, the custom solutions we implemented to address them, and the lessons learned during system integration and testing. This retrospective highlights both the technical hurdles we faced\u2014such as SLAM, conflicting control inputs, and TF management\u2014and the strategies we adopted to overcome them, including remapping, custom planner development, and refined system architecture.</p>"},{"location":"#challenges-custom-development-and-solutions","title":"Challenges, Custom Development, and Solutions","text":"<ul> <li>SLAM Integration Issues: One of our original objectives was to use SLAM-generated maps for enhanced path planning and localization. While we successfully demonstrated navigation using maps created in a controlled lab setting (see Figure and accompanying Navigation with Map video), this success was inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably. The core issues stemmed from turtlebot4_navigation package.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Obstacle Avoidance Conflicts: The Reactive Gap Finder generally performed well in local navigation. However, occasional collisions with obstacles persisted, despite extensive parameter tuning. To mitigate this, we attempted to combine gap-based obstacle avoidance with Nav2\u2019s dynamic mapping and planning features. Integration proved difficult due to command conflicts: both the Nav2 controller and our custom node were publishing velocity commands to the /cmd_vel topic simultaneously, resulting in erratic behavior and deviations from the intended path. Attempts to resolve this by modifying the nav2.yaml configuration file were unsuccessful, as demonstrated in our test video.</p> </li> <li> <p>Custom Development: To overcome dependencies on the Nav2 stack, we explored a fully custom approach by developing a lightweight A* planner. This planner receives the estimated user position and direction as a goal and generates a corresponding trajectory. However, for this approach to be fully functional, proper access to the robot\u2019s coordinate frames (TFs) is essential.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Despite several attempts, we were unable to consistently obtain the necessary TFs (e.g., odom, base_link, map) within our custom node. The node was only able to access the map frame, and transformations between key frames were missing. As a result, although the robot could localize itself in the map frame, the lack of proper frame transformations caused it to deviate from the generated path as illustrated in our test video.</p>"},{"location":"#proposed-solutions-and-workarounds","title":"Proposed Solutions and Workarounds","text":"<ul> <li>Resolving \"Full Queue\" Errors and Dropped TF Messages</li> </ul> <p>A common error we encountered involved message queues filling up and dropped TF messages. A practical solution was to remap TF topics explicitly: /tf := /rpi_11/tf /tf_static := /rpi_11/tf_static</p> <p>This remapping became necessary after I noticed an error message pop up when I closed RViz while SLAM and RViz were running together. The message highlighted improper remappings like /tf:=tf and /tf_static:=tf_static, which are ineffective.</p> <ul> <li>Editing Configuration Files</li> </ul> <p>In /opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot4_navigation/config, YAML files define parameters for SLAM, localization, and the Nav2 stack. We experimented with editing these files to disable or replace certain components\u2014such as removing the default planner server in favor of our own.

It receives target pose goals from clients, simulates navigation by periodically publishing feedback (e.g., distance remaining), and returns a result upon completion to indicate whether the goal was successfully reached or not.

If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.  If you are using MathML input rather than TeX (e.g., <code>mml-chtml.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), then you can remove <code>input/tex/extensions</code> as well.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#the-component-files-and-pull-requests","title":"The Component Files and Pull Requests","text":"<p>The <code>es5</code> directory is generated automatically from the contents of the MathJax source repository.
