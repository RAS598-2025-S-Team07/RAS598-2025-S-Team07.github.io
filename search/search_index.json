This system will enable hands-free transportation of small items (e.g., groceries, shopping bags, or tools) and assist with tasks like carrying a camera for photography or videography.

Due to the limited field of view of the depth camera and the desire to reduce computational load on the Raspberry Pi, we have adopted shoe detection as a lightweight and focused approach for user identification. A custom-trained model will detect the user's shoes, allowing us to estimate their direction relative to the image center. The image data will be processed externally on a PC or online on the raspberry pi, and the results will be used to guide robot's motion.</p> <p>LiDAR will be used for 360-degree obstacle detection and distance maintenance, and will play a central role in real-time gap-finding navigation. In situations where the robot is unable to find a viable local path using the gap-finding algorithm, it will fall back on a pre-built SLAM map to determine an alternative route. This layered approach allows the robot to adapt intelligently to dynamic and complex environments.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#data-collection-image-processing","title":"Data collection &amp; Image processing","text":"<p>To detect and localize shoes we focuse on developing a machine learning model capable of detecting shoes and estimating their position on-screen using an OAK-D camera mounted on a TurtleBot. The camera is fixed at a height of 192 mm from the ground, and its field of view has been calibrated to account for perspective distortion, including a measured offset of 180 mm between the camera\u2019s optical center and the center of the captured image. </p> <p></p> <p>Data collection was performed in a controlled indoor environment to ensure consistency, with the camera mounted on a tripod and a coordinate system marked on the floor to map image coordinates to physical positions as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>To capture the variability in shoe placement, eight different images were taken at each floor coordinate. Additionally, to teach the model to infer depth, five images were captured at varying distances from a fixed origin for each shoe position. Each image in the dataset is annotated with the shoe's bounding box, its physical distance from the camera, and its relative floor coordinate. </p> <p>As distance increases, both the bounding box size and screen mapping change due to perspective scaling. The proposed machine learning pipeline includes an object detection backbone\u2014such as YOLOv8 or SSD\u2014to identify shoes and predict bounding boxes, followed by a regression-based localization head to estimate the shoe's  coordinates (x,y) and, optionally, its physical distance from the camera. The overall methodology consists of several steps: data collection using the calibrated camera setup, preprocessing involving image normalization and augmentation (e.g., rotation and brightness variation), supervised training using annotated labels, rigorous evaluation on unseen environments and lighting conditions, and finally, real-time deployment integrated with the OAK-D camera\u2019s live stream to enable real-time shoe localization on the robot.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#control-and-autonomy","title":"Control and Autonomy","text":"<p>The depth camera will be used to detect the user's shoes in real-time, providing a simple yet effective method for user recognition and direction estimation.

This information will be translated into the user\u2019s direction relative to the robot and communicated back to the TurtleBot over ROS2, allowing it to adjust its motion accordingly.</p> <p>LiDAR will be the primary sensor for dynamic obstacle detection, gap-finding, and distance maintenance. It will also help refine the robot\u2019s understanding of the user\u2019s position by correlating the visual direction from the camera with the LiDAR scan to estimate the user\u2019s distance. In cases where the gap-finding algorithm cannot identify a safe path forward, the robot will utilize a prebuilt SLAM map to determine an alternative route around obstacles, ensuring reliable and adaptive navigation in cluttered environments.</p>"},{"location":"#current-progress","title":"Current Progress","text":"<p>In our previous revision, we introduced the use of SLAM as a secondary navigation method. In this architecture, the robot primarily relies on a reactive gap-finding algorithm for real-time obstacle avoidance. However, in situations where a passable gap cannot be identified, the robot falls back on the SLAM-generated map to make informed navigation decisions. While the core logic of our system remains unchanged, we have made several refinements. In the updated setup, a SLAM node runs continuously to map the environment as the robot moves. Once the user\u2019s heading is determined, it is sent as a goal to the Nav2 planner server. This server generates a global path based on the current map. My custom Reactive Gap Finder node, which subscribes to the /rpi_11/plan topic, receives this path, follows it, and performs local obstacle avoidance by identifying and navigating through gaps in the environment.</p> <p>Current Challenges:</p> <ul> <li> <p>SLAM Integration Issues: Although our goal was to use the SLAM-generated map for secondary path planning, issues with the <code>turtlebot4_navigation</code> package have made this integration difficult. I was able to successfully demonstrate the robot navigating using a map generated from my lab environment (see Figure 1 and the Navigation with Map video), but this success was not consistently reproducible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obstacle Avoidance Conflicts: While the Reactive Gap Finder generally performs well, I observed that the robot occasionally collides with obstacles despite significant parameter tuning. This is the primary motivation behind fusing it with the Nav2 dynamic mapping and planning capabilities. However, integration poses a challenge: to avoid conflicting commands, we must isolate the <code>planner_server</code> from the full <code>turtlebot4_navigation</code> stack. When both the Nav2 controller and my reactive gap logic publish to the <code>/cmd_vel</code> topic, the robot receives mixed commands and deviates from the intended path. This behavior is shown in the accompanying demonstration video. Attempts to resolve this by editing the <code>nav2.yaml</code> file were unsuccessful.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Potential Final Solution: In case we can not use the nav2 and its planner server, we stick to my Reactive gap finder and we make sure to use the gaps that are in the direction of user. </p>"},{"location":"#graphical-user-interface-gui","title":"Graphical User Interface (GUI)","text":""},{"location":"#current-progress_1","title":"Current Progress:","text":"<p>In this component of our project, we are simulate a ROS 2 NavigateToPose action server and integrate it with a PyQt5 graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize robot sensor data and navigation status. The action server acts as a dummy implementation that mimics the behavior of the standard NavigateToPose interface in ROS 2. It receives target pose goals from clients, simulates navigation by periodically publishing feedback (e.g., distance remaining), and returns a result upon completion to indicate whether the goal was successfully reached or not. Users can send goals using the ROS 2 command-line interface, specifying the desired position and orientation within the map frame. On the GUI side, we use PyQt5 to create a clean interface that displays LIDAR scan data, camera images, and the current status of the navigation process. The interface includes buttons to trigger visualizations and a status label that reflects the robot\u2019s current state (e.g., Idle, Navigating, Completed). The GUI listens to the GoalStatusArray topic to receive real-time updates on the navigation goal, dynamically showing statuses such as Accepted, In Progress, or Aborted. In the final version, we replace the action server with the robot action server enabling us to monitor the navigation status. Loging buttons and camera will remain as tools for debugging purposes, while Lidar data display might not be needed in the final version. </p>"},{"location":"#preparation-needs","title":"Preparation Needs","text":""},{"location":"#what-do-you-need-to-know-to-be-successful","title":"What do you need to know to be successful?","text":"<ul> <li>Learn to calibrate and operate the hardware like camera, LiDAR, Raspberry Pi</li> <li>Machine learning tools or OpenCV for optimal image processing</li> <li>Data filtering</li> <li>Control Logic and data flow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#which-of-those-topics-do-you-need-to-cover-in-class","title":"Which of those topics do you need to cover in class?","text":"<ul> <li>Data filtering</li> <li>Control Logic and data flow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#final-demonstration","title":"Final Demonstration","text":"<p>Conditions change in any environment.

To address this, more advanced image processing algorithms that are robust to lighting variations will be explored. - In scenarios where the robot encounters narrow gaps that are smaller than its diameter, the robot needs predefined behavior. In our case, The robot will use SLAM and mapping as an alternative mean of motion planning. - To maintain accurate user tracking during movement, an optimal update rate for user position data will be determined.
